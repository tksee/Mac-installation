To let Rstudio markdown to output PDF file, I downloaded MacTex

Download MacTeX.pkg(June2015) on firefox, and install it.
 http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html

Following the "READ ME FIRST.pdf", opened TeXShop.
There were some updatings or installations

I opened TeX live utility, got error;
 Repository URL has a newer TeXLive Version. Your TeX Live version is 0, but your default repository URL appears to be for TeX Live 2015. You need to manually upgrade 
Following this website, I opened the preference, changed the TeX programs to usr/TeX/texbin

I got massage "infrastructure update succeeded"

Closed TeXShop and Tex Live Utility and Rstudio. Then opened Rstudio and successfully knitted PDF file.
